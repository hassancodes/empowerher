# Purpose:
* **Help Women** get **medical** and **mental Health** Assistance from professional Doctor while staying anonymous.
* Share Your stories anonymously without getting **judged**.

# Why I build this?
* This is a hackathon (hackVoilet at Virginia Tech) project that I build in 24 hours.

# Technologies I used:
* Flask for backend 
* MongoDB for database
* Bootstrap for frontend design (Since I need to finish this quickly)



### What I learned

* During a hackathon, we faced several challenges while using MongoDB and Flask as our database and web framework. One of the major issues we encountered was with the integration of MongoDB and Flask. As we were working under a tight deadline, it was difficult to resolve the compatibility issues between the two technologies. Additionally, we also struggled with scaling the database to handle the large amount of data we were collecting. Furthermore, there were limited resources and expertise available to troubleshoot any problems we faced with the database and web framework. Despite these challenges, we were able to find workarounds and find solutions to the problems through research and collaboration with our team.
